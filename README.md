# Personal Website

At one point I had planned on writing blog posts, but I did not get around to doing so. Maybe someday!

For now, this is used as a testbed and as a landing page for anyone who finds their way here from another project.

## Deployment

This is currently deployed/hosted by CloudFlare pages because it's free and easy to use. I'm also using CloudFlare Workers for URL rewrites (e.g. to serve my Resume/CV) and also to add security headers to the site.
